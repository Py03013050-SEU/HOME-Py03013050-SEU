**Software** is a program or set of **programs** containing instructions which provide desired functionality . 

**Engineering** is the **processes** of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and find a cost effective solution to problems.


**Software Engineering** is **a systematic approach** to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.


## Dual Role of Software:

### 1. As a product –

* It delivers the computing potential across network of Hardware.

* It enables the Hardware to deliver the expected functionality.

* It acts as information transformer because it produces, manages, acquires, modifies, displays, or transmits information.

### 2. As a vehicle for delivering a product

* It provides system functionality (e.g., payroll system)

* It controls other software (e.g., an operating system)

* It helps build other software (e.g., software tools)

### Objectives of Software Engineering:

1. Maintainability
 
  * It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.

2. Correctness 
 
  * A software product is correct, if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented.

3. Reusability 
 
  * A software product has good reusability, if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.

4. Testability 
 
  * Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria.

5. Reliability 
 
  * It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.

6. Portability 
   * In this case, software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.

7. Adaptability –
   * In this case, software allows differing system constraints and user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.
