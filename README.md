[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/43438544.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/43438544)

We will cover:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* Object-oriented Programming
* [GCC and Make](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 
* a useful set of algorithms and data structure
* testing and version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
* introduction to [Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/)

[Practices](https://github.com/thermalogic/Practices/) are the very important part of the course. 

**行是知之始，知是行之成 - 陶行知**

After completing the course, We wish you have a broad spectrum of computer knowledge, is a good programmer in the context of using computation to solve complex problems and keep pace with the latest developments in computer technology.

## Using the Notebooks of thermalogic/SEES 

`download/clone` the repository to your computer,then start Jupyter to  **interactive** with the notebooks.

* Download the *thermalogic/SEES* Repository  

  You can manually download the `zip` file of the `thermalogic/SEES` to your computer

* Using the Jupyter Notebooks of thermalogic/SEES:  

   Unzip the **zip** file, then, in the sub-folder of **notebook** of SEES, double-click `nb.bat`(OS:Windows). This will open a web page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.

>We **recommend** that you use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone and update the repository
>
>**Cloning the B2022 branch of repository shallowly for saving bandwidth**
>
>```bash
>git clone --depth 1 -b B2022 https://github.com/thermalogic/SEES.git
>```
>**Updating to The Latest Version**
>
>```bash
>git pull
>```
