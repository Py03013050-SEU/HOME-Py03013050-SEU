    "The notion of an optimization problem provides a structured way to think about solving lots of computational problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, an optimization problem has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>An objective function</b> that is to be maximized or minimized. For example, the airfare between Boston and Istanbul.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>A set of constraints</b> (possibly empty) that must be honored. For example, an upper bound on the travel time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main things to take away from this chapter are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Many problems of real importance can be simply formulated in a way that leads naturally to a computational solution.\n",
    "<li>Reducing a seemingly new problem to an instance of a well-known problem allows one to use preexisting solutions.\n",
    "<li>Exhaustive enumeration algorithms provide a simple, but often computationally intractable, way to search for optimal solutions.\n",
    "<li>A greedy algorithm is often a practical approach to finding a pretty good,but not always optimal, solution to an optimization problem.\n",
    "<li>Knapsack problems and graph problems are classes of problems to which other problems can often be reduced.\n",

In addition to the obvious problems (making sure that a home is empty, picking locks, circumventing alarms, dealing with ethical quandaries,etc.), a burglar has to decide what to steal.

He needs to find the set of things that provides the most value without exceeding his carrying capacity.\n",
