    "### Assumption of Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of independence is used for several other statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s essential to getting results from your <b>sample</b> that reflect what you would find in a <b>population</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even the smallest dependence in your data can turn into heavily biased results (which may be undetectable) if you violate this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>dependence</b> is <b>a connection</b> between your data. For example, how much you earn depends upon how many hours you work. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Independence</b> means there <b>isn’t a connection</b>. For example, how much you earn isn’t connected to what you ate for breakfast. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>assumption of independence</b> means that your <b>data isn’t connected in any way</b> (at least, in ways that you haven’t accounted for in your model).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually two assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1 **The observations between groups should be independent,**\n",
    "\n",
    "which basically means the groups are made up of different people. You don’t want one person appearing twice in two different groups as it could skew your results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2 **The observations within each group must be independent.** \n",
    "\n",
    "If two or more data points in one group are connected in some way, this could also skew your data. For example, let’s say you were taking a snapshot of how many donuts people ate, and you took snapshots every morning at 9,10, and 11 a.m.. You might conclude that office workers eat 25% of their daily calories from donuts. However, you made the mistake of timing the snapshots too closely together in the morning when people were more likely to bring bags of donuts in to share (making them dependent). If you had taken your measurements at 7, noon and 4 p.m., this would probably have made your measurements independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do I Avoid Violating the Assumption?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, looking at your data and trying to see if you have independence or not is usually difficult or impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to avoiding violating the assumption of independence is to make sure your data is independent while you are collecting it. If you aren’t an expert in your field, this can be challenging.\n"

    "## 22.2 Tests Are Imperfect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every experiment should be viewed as a `potentially flawed` test**. We can perform a test for a chemical, a phenomenon, a disease, etc. However, the event for which we are testing is not necessarily the same as the result of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professors design exams with the goal of understanding how well a student has mastered some subject matter, but the result of the exam should not be confused with how much a student actually understands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every test has some inherent error rate. Imagine that a student learning a second language has been asked to learn the meaning of 100 words, but has learned the meaning of only 80 of them. His rate of understanding is 80%, but the probability that he will score 80% on a test with 20 words is certainly not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests can have both false negatives and false positives**. As we saw in Chapter 20, a negative mammogram does not guarantee absence of breast cancer, and a positive mammogram doesn’t guarantee its presence. Furthermore, the test probability and the event probability are not the same thing. This is especially relevant when testing for a rare event, e.g., the presence of a rare disease. If the cost of a false  negative is high(e.g., missing the presence of a serious but curable disease), the test should be designed to be highly sensitive, even at the cost of there being a large number of false positives.\n",

    "The Nobel prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman tells a story about anIsraeli Air Force flight instructor who rejected Kahneman’s assertion that “rewards for improved performance work better than punishment for mistakes.” The instructor’s argument was “On many occasions I have praised flights cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver. The next time they try the same maneuver they usually do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed into a cadet’s earphone for bad execution, and in general he does better on the next try.”153 It is natural for humans to imagine a treatment effect, because we like to think causally. But sometimes it is simply a matter of luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagining a treatment effect when there is none can be dangerous. It can lead to the belief that vaccinations are harmful, that snake oil cures all aches and pains, or that investing exclusively in mutual funds that “beat the market” last year is a good strategy.\n",

    "An admissions officer at the Maui Institute of Technology (MIT), wishing to convince the world that MIT’s admissions process is “gender-blind,” trumpeted, “At MIT, there\n",
    "is no significant difference between the grade point averages of men and women.” The same day, an ardent female chauvinist proclaimed that “At MIT, the women have a\n",
    "significantly higher grade point average than the men.” A puzzled reporter at the student newspaper decided to examine the data and expose the liar. But when she finally\n",
    "managed to pry the data out of the university, she concluded that both were telling the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the sentence, “At MIT, the women have a significantly higher grade point average than the men,” actually mean? People who have not studied statistics (most of\n",
    "the population) would probably conclude that there is a “meaningful” difference between the GPAs of women and men attending MIT. In contrast, those who have\n",
    "recently studied statistics might conclude only that 1) the average GPA of women is higher than that of men, and 2) the null hypothesis that the difference in GPA can be\n",
    "attributed to randomness can be rejected at the 5% level \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, that there were 2500 women and 2500 men studying at MIT. Suppose further that the mean GPA of men was 3.5, the mean GPA of women was 3.51, and the standard deviation of the GPA for both men and women was 0.25. Most sensible people would consider the difference in GPAs “insignificant.” However, from a statistical point of view the difference is “significant” at close to the 2% level. What is the root of this strange dichotomy? As we showed in Section 19.5, when a study has enough power—i.e, enough examples—even insignificant differences can be statistically significant.\n",

    "A related problem arises when a study is very small. Suppose you flipped a coin twice and it came up heads both times. Now, let’s use the two-tailed one-sample t-test\n",
    "we saw in Section 19.3 to test the null hypothesis that the coin is fair. If we assume that the value of heads is 1 and the value of tails is 0, we can get the p-value using the code\n"
