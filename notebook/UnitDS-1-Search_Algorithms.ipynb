    "## 10.1 Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A search algorithm is a method for finding an item or group of items with specific properties within a collection of items. \n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the collection of items as a <b>search space</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The search space might be something concrete, such as a set of electronic medical records, or something abstract, such as the set of all integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will examine two algorithms for searching a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each meets **the specification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(L, e):\n",
    "\"\"\"Assumes L is a list.\n",
    "   Returns True if e is in L and False otherwise\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The astute reader might wonder if this is not semantically equivalent to the Python expression\n",
    "```python\n",
    "e in L\n",
    "``` \n",
    "The answer is yes, it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one is unconcerned about the efficiency of discovering whether **e is in L**, one should simply write that expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.1 Linear Search and Using <font color='blue'>Indirection</font> to Access Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the following algorithm to determine if an element is in a list\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(L, e):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(L)): # O(len(L))\n",
    "        if L[i] == e:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element **e** is not in the list the algorithm will perform <b>O(len(L))</b> tests\n",
    "\n",
    "* the complexity is <b>at best linear</b> in the length of L.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Why “at best” linear? **\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be linear **only if** : each operation **inside the loop can be **done** in **constant time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by considering the simple case:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  each element of the list is an **integer**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the **address** in memory of the ith element of the list is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "* $start + 4i$\n",
    "\n",
    "where **start** is the address of the start of the list, integer variable occupy 4 bytes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can assume that Python could compute the address of the ith element of a list of integers in constant time\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **list** is represented as a **length** (the number of objects in the list) and a sequence of **fixed-size pointers** to **objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure illustrates the use of these pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The shaded region represents a list containing four elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <font color=\"red\">The leftmost shaded box</font> contains a pointer to an integer indicating the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**IF** \n",
    "\n",
    "* the length field is four units of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* each pointer (address) occupies four units of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "the address of the ith element of the list is stored at the address\n",
    "\n",
    "$start + 4 + 4i$\n",
    "\n",
    "this address can be found in constant time, and then the value stored at that address can be used to access the ith element. This access too is a constant-time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates one of the most important implementation techniques  used in computing: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>indirection</b>\n",
    "  \n",
    "   * Generally speaking, indirection involves accessing something by \n",

    "     **first accessing something else** that contains <b>a reference</b> to the thing initially sought.\n",
    "     \n",
    "This is what happens each time we use a variable to refer to the object to which that variable is bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a variable to **access a list** and then a reference stored in that list to **access another object**, we are going through two levels of indirection.\n"
