    "<b style=\"color:blue\">It is often better, however, to slow down a little.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the goal is not to fix one bug, but to move rapidly and efficiently towards a bug-free program.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\"> Ask yourself if this bug explains all the observed symptoms, or whether it is just the tip of the iceberg</span>. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the latter, it may be better to think about taking care of this bug in concert with other changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, that you have discovered that the bug is the result of having accidentally `mutated a list`. You could circumvent the problem locally, perhaps by making a copy of the list. Alternatively, you could consider `using a tuple instead of a list` (since tuples are immutable), perhaps eliminating imilar bugs elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">Before making any change, try and `understand the ramification` of the proposed “fix.”</span>.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is nothing more frustrating than realizing that a long series of changes have left you farther from the goal than when you started, and having no way to get back to where you started. Disk space is usually plentiful. Use it to store old versions of your program:\n",
