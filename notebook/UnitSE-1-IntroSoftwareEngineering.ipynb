    "## 1 Introduction to Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software** is a program or set of **programs** containing instructions which provide desired functionality . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Engineering** is the **processes** of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and find a cost effective solution to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software Engineering** is **a systematic approach** to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Dual Role of Software:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. As a product –\n",
    "\n",
    "* It delivers the computing potential across network of Hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It enables the Hardware to deliver the expected functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It acts as information transformer because it produces, manages, acquires, modifies, displays, or transmits information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. As a vehicle for delivering a product\n",
    "\n",
    "* It provides system functionality (e.g., payroll system)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It controls other software (e.g., an operating system)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It helps build other software (e.g., software tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Objectives of Software Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maintainability\n",
    " \n",
    "  * It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Correctness \n",
    " \n",
    "  * A software product is correct, if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reusability \n",
    " \n",
    "  * A software product has good reusability, if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Testability \n",
    " \n",
    "  * Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reliability \n",
    " \n",
    "  * It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Portability \n",
    "   * In this case, software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Adaptability –\n",
    "   * In this case, software allows differing system constraints and user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software."

    "## 2 The Software Development Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists refer to the process of planning and organizing a program as software development. There are several approaches to software development. One version is known as the **waterfall model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The waterfall model consists of several phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer request—In this phase, the programmers receive a broad statement of\n",
    "a problem that is potentially amenable to a computerized solution. This step is also\n",
    "called the user requirements phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analysis—The programmers determine what the program will do. This is sometimes\n",
    "viewed as a process of clarifying the specifications for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Design—The programmers determine how the program will do its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implementation—The programmers write the program. This step is also called the\n",
    "coding phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Integration—Large programs have many parts. In the integration phase, these parts\n",
    "are brought together into a smoothly functioning whole, usually not an easy task.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Maintenance—Programs usually have a long life; a life span of 5 to 15 years is common\n",
    "for software. During this time, requirements change, errors are detected, and\n",
    "minor or major modifications are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phases of the waterfall model are shown in Figure 2-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "![waterfall model](./img/ds/waterfall_model.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the figure resembles a waterfall, in which the results of each phase flow down to the next. However, a mistake\n",
    "detected in one phase often requires the developer to back up and redo some of the work in the previous phase. Modifications made during maintenance also require backing up to earlier phases. Taken together, these phases are also called **the software development life cycle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the diagram depicts distinct phases, this does not mean that developers must analyze and design a complete system before coding it. Modern software development is usually **incremental** and **iterative**. This means that analysis and design may produce a\n",
    "`rough draft, skeletal version, or prototype of a system for coding`, and then back up to earlier phases to fill in more details after some testing. For purposes of introducing this process, however, we treat these phases as distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs rarely work as hoped the first time they are run; hence, they should be subjected to extensive and careful testing. Many people think that testing is an activity that applies only to the implementation and integration phases; however, you should scrutinize the outputs of each phase carefully. Keep in mind that mistakes found early are much less expensive to correct than those found late. Figure 2-2 illustrates some relative costs of repairing mistakes when found in different phases. These are not just financial costs but also costs in time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "![costs_mistakes](./img/ds/costs_mistakes.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the cost of developing software is not spread equally over the phases.The percentages shown in Figure 2-3 are typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "![percentage_costs](./img/ds/percentage_costs.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that implementation takes the most time and therefore costs the most.However, as you can see in Figure 2-3, maintenance is the most expensive part of software development. The cost of maintenance can be reduced by careful analysis, design, and\n",
    "implementation.As you read this book and begin to sharpen your programming skills, you should remember two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is more to software development than writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you want to reduce the overall cost of software development, write programs that are easy to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "This requires thorough analysis, careful design, and a good coding style. We will have more to say about coding styles throughout\n",
