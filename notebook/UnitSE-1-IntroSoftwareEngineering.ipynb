    "# Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Software engineering was first introduced in the 1960s in an effort to treat more rigorously the often frustrating task of designing and developing computer programs. It was around this time that the computer community became increasingly worried about the fact that software projects were typically over budget and behind schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term **software crisis（软件危机）** came to signify that software development was the bottleneck in the advancement of computer technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Introduction to Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Software Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "From an engineering viewpoint a software system is a product that serves a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, \n",
    "\n",
    "**1 A program can be changed**：\n",
    "\n",
    "one unique attribute makes a computer program much different from a bridge or an airplane: a program can be changed. This malleability of software is both an advantage and a danger. \n",
    "  * An advantage because it is often possible to correct an error in a program much easier than it would be to fix a defect in an airplane or automobile.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *  A danger because a modification in a program can introduce unanticipated side effects that may impair the functionality of those components that were executing correctly before the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The most important element of the Software product cost is the human effort in design and development**\n",
    "\n",
    "The another notable characteristic of programs relate to the type of `resources necessary for their creation`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A software product is basically an intellectual commodity. The principal resource necessary for producing it is `human intelligence`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual manufacturing of programs is `simple and inexpensive` compared to its design, coding, testing, and documenting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This contrasts with many other engineered products in which the resources used in producing it are a substantial part of the product’s\n",
    "final cost. For example, a considerable portion of the price of a new automobile represents the cost of manufacturing it, while a less significant part goes to pay for the engineering costs of design and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a typical computer program the proportions are reversed. The most important element of the product cost is the human effort in design and development while the cost of manufacturing is proportionally insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Software Qualities\n",
    "\n",
    "An engineered product is usually associated with a list of qualities that define its usability. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in performing its functions a bridge supports a predetermined weight and withstands a given wind force. An airplane is capable of transporting a\n",
    "specific load, at a certain speed and altitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the same token, a software product is associated with a given set of qualities that define its functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "The principal goals of software engineering is to define, specify, and measure software qualities and to describe the principles that can be applied to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of software qualities can be based on the relation with the software product. In this sense we can speak of qualities desirable to the user,to the developer, or to the manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Table lists some qualities according to this classification.\n",

    "We started this chapter on the assumption that software development is a `creative activity` and that programming is `not an exact science`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this point of view even the term software engineering may be considered unsuitable since we could preferably\n",
    "speak of `software development technique`, which term does not imply the rigor of a formal engineering approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our opinion it is a `mistake` to assume that programs can be mechanically generated by some `mechanical methodology`, no matter\n",
    "how sophisticated. \n",
    "\n",
    "When software engineering falls short of producing the expected results it is because we `over-stressed the scientific and technical aspects` of program development over those that are `artistic or aesthetic` in nature or that depend on talent, personal endowments, or know-how. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, as there is `technique in art`, there is `technique in program development`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software engineering is the `conventional` name that `groups` the technical and scientific aspects of program development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Software Engineering** is **a systematic approach** to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">* 软件工程是设计、开发、操作和维护软件系统的系统化方法。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smaller software projects** usually take place within the constraints of a limited budget. Often financial resources do not extend to hiring trained software project managers or specialists in the field of software engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The person in charge of the project usually wears many hats, including that of project manager and software engineer. In fact, it is not unusual that the project manager/engineer is also part-time designer, programmer, tester, and documentation specialist. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this all means is that the formality and rigor used in engineering a major project may not apply to one of lesser proportions. In other words, the strictness and rigidity of software engineering principles may have to be scaled down to accommodate the smaller projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense we must distinguish between `principles, techniques, and tools` of software engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Principles** are general guidelines that are applicable at any stage of the program production process. They are the abstract statements that describe desirable properties, but that are of little use in practical software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the principle that encourages high program reliability does `not tell us how to` make a program reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques or methods** refer to `a particular approach` to solving a problem and help ensure that a product will have the desirable\n",
    "properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are specific resources that are used in implementing a particular technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we may state as a principle that floating-point numbers are a desirable format for representing decimals in a digital machine. Also that the floating-point techniques described in the ANSI standard 754 are suitable for our application\n",
    "and should be followed. Finally, that a particular library of floating-point routines, which complies with ANSI 754, would be an adequate tool for implementing the mathematical functions required in our application.\n",

    "It includes project planning, systems and requirements analysis, data structure design, algorithm selection and evaluation, coding,\n",
    "estimation of program correctness, and maintenance procedures.\n",

    "There are several paradigms to software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of these paradigms have been extensively discussed in the literature:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the waterfall model(瀑布模型), the prototype methods(原型方法), and the spiral model(螺旋模式)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Waterfall Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This classical Waterfall Model of a software engineering project is based on the notion of a system life-cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The waterfall model consists of several phases shown in the Figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the figure resembles a waterfall, in which the results of each phase flow **down** to the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "![waterfall model](./img/ee/waterfall.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1 The specification phase(规范设计阶段）** consists of `a requirements gathering process` through analysis and systems engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the project must interface with existing software or hardware elements the specification phase must include a systems requirements definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this phase customer and developer work very closely: the customer provides the requirements and the developer reflects these requirements in a formal specification that is, in turn, reviewed by the customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements/specification cycles continue until both parties agree that the project has been clearly and unambiguously defined.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The programmers determine **what the program** will do. This is a process of clarifying the **specifications（规范说明书)** for the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 The design phase(设计阶段)**  on four elements: data structures, program architecture, procedures, and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design stage is often the most critical and difficult one. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The programmers determine **how the program** will do its task\n",
    "\n",
    "**3 The coding phase(编码阶段)**: The programmers write the program,then convert the design into a machine-executable product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4 The verification phase(测试阶段）** Once the code executes in a machine it must be evaluated for correctness. This means that we must ascertain that it meets the requirements developed during the specifications phase and that it is free from defects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this phase is sometimes associated with debugging, it should also include all formal and experimental verifications of program correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "**5 Maintenancephase（维护阶段)**—Programs usually have a long life; a life span of 5 to 15 years is common for software. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this time, requirements change, errors are detected, and minor or major modifications are made.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You should remember two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is **more** to software development than `writing code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you want to reduce the overall cost of software development, **write programs that are easy to maintain**. This requires thorough analysis, careful design, and a good coding style. "
